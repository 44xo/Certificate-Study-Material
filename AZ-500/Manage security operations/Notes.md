  - **Alert Enrichment**:
    - **Entity Mapping**: Map query results to Sentinel-recognized entities to enrich alerts and incidents.
    - **Custom Details**: Extract and surface event data in alerts.
    - **Alert Details**: Override default alert properties with details from query results.
    - Note: The alert size limit is 64 KB.

  - **Query Scheduling and Alert Threshold**:
    - Set query frequency in the **Run query every** field (e.g., every 5 minutes to every 14 days).
    - Define the data coverage period in the **Lookup data from the last** field.
    - Account for a 5-minute ingestion delay to avoid data duplication.
    - Set alert sensitivity in the **Alert threshold** section by specifying a result threshold (e.g., generate alert if results > 1000).

  - **Incident Creation Settings**:
    - Configure whether alerts should generate incidents and how to group alerts into incidents.
    - **Alert Grouping**: Group alerts based on entity matches or other criteria to form single incidents from up to 150 alerts.
    - Optionally enable re-opening of closed incidents if new related alerts are generated.

  - **Automated Responses**:
    - Use the **Automated responses** tab to set automation rules for when alerts are generated, incidents created, or incidents updated.
    - Create automation rules for basic triage, assignment, workflow, and closing incidents, or invoke playbooks for more complex tasks.
